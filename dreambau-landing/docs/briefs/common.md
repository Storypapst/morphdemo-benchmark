# Shared brief for all three productions

**Where this lives.** The landing page of dreambau.com (a building / construction company in Berlin). On every load the page
plays one of three productions, picked at random. Each production is a complete audiovisual piece of about one minute.
The theme, taken over from the MorphDemo benchmark this work is derived from, is **FROM NOISE TO ORDER**, and for a
builder it reads naturally: *rubble and static become a plan, the plan becomes a building, the building becomes a place.*

**The only text** (given by the owner, not up for creative change). It is drawn by the production, line by line, in this order:

1. `Jeht nich…`
2. `jibs nich…`
3. `dreambau.com`

It means "can't be done doesn't exist" in Berlin dialect: a promise that the impossible gets built. Show the lines on musical
events. The three lines are provided by the runtime as distance fields (`tdist`) and as particle targets (`tpt`), see
`docs/CONTRACT.md`. Afterwards the page itself adds the small closing line `info@dreambau.com (nich warten, quatschen)` at the
bottom: keep the bottom 12 % of the final composition calm and dark.

**Tone.** Confident, warm, a little humorous, never kitschy. This is a company's front door, not a tech demo reel: no plasma,
no rotozoomers, no lens-flare spam, no stock "matrix" rain. Real craft in the details: timing, easing, restraint, colour.

**Structure (all three).** `dur` 60 s, `fin` 53 s, `cta` 54.5 s.
Emergence (0 to ~13 s): sparse, noisy, unstable, nearly black at t=0, and the sound starts almost silent.
Transformation (~13 to ~40 s): structure appears, grows and becomes musical (a beat enters around 13 s).
Resolution (~40 to 60 s): the first word arrives at 40-43 s, the second at 44-47 s, the last (`dreambau.com`) at 48-51 s,
each on a musical event; the final composition is stable and legible from `fin`, the music resolves and fades out by `dur`.

**Do not** name any AI model, tool vendor or person in files, comments or reports you write. Comments in English.

**Definition of done** (check every point, fix, repeat):

- [ ] `node tools/build.mjs <id>` is within the size budget of the production file.
- [ ] `node tools/audio.mjs <id>` reports no problems; the spectrogram shows the intended structure; the three word hits are audible events at the times the picture reveals the words.
- [ ] `node tools/shot.mjs <id> --every 2.5 --sheet` reviewed with your own eyes (open `verification/<id>/frames/sheet.png` with the Read tool): clearly distinct phases, steady visible motion, no dead period longer than 3 s, `t=0` almost black, final composition legible.
- [ ] Final composition checked at 960x540, at portrait `--size 390x844` and wide `--size 1680x720` (text and subject fully visible, bottom band calm).
- [ ] Text contrast in the final frame: the words are clearly brighter than their surroundings (aim for contrast ≥ 7:1 against the local background) and have crisp anti-aliased edges.
- [ ] `node tools/bench.mjs <id>`: worst frame ≤ ~150 ms at 640x360 in software GL.
- [ ] `node tools/e2e.mjs <id>` passes.
- [ ] No console errors or warnings from the page.
- [ ] `verification/<id>/REPORT.md` written: what you built (2-3 sentences), timeline table (time, picture, sound), the sync points, measured size/budget, bench numbers, known weaknesses.

Edit **only** `src/p/<id>.js` and write only below `verification/<id>/`. Never run `node tools/build.mjs` without an id.
If you need a runtime or tool change, do not edit those files: describe it in your final report.
